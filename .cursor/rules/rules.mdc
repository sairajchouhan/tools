- use bun to install any package and use bunx to temporarily run any script from a package
- to add shadcn component use latest shadcn package not shadcn-ui package
- do not ever suggest to start the development server because most of the times I have a developmet server running anytime so don't ever do that
- when ever you add some component first check if shadcn component has it, like for example a button you should not ever re-create a button from scratch just use what is provided from shadcn
- never write svgs from scratch I am using lucide-react icons component lib check [package.json](mdc:package.json) you will see lucide icons
